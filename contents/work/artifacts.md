Part audio tour, part live theatre, <a href="https://www.lrplays.org/work/artifacts-2019"><i>Artifacts</i></a> was a one-of-a-kind, site-inspired event conceived and created by Jessy, which led audiences deep into a labyrinthine urban artifacts store in Chicago and even deeper into the lives of two different narrators.
