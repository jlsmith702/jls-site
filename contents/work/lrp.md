<a href="https://lrplays.org">Living Room Playmakers was a group of artists who came together to create site-inspired, playwright-driven theatre in Chicago from 2012 to 2019. Jessy co-founded the group, and wrote and produced sold-out plays for bedrooms, bars, art installations, beaches, and furniture stores.
