Living Room Playmakers was a group of artists who met through grad school and day jobs, and came together to create site-inspired, playwright-driven theatre in Chicago from 2012 to 2019. Jessy co-founded the group, and wrote and produced sold-out plays for bedrooms, bars, art installations, beaches, and furniture stores.
