Jessy co-created <a href="https://adventproject.org">The Advent Project</a> in 2019 to make December feel a little bit warmer. It gathers 24 pieces of brand-new, bite-sized, multimedia art by different artists and releases them to donors throughout December. The project has raised over $13,000 for worthy causes thus far.
